# Basic C# Projects

This repository contains projects and demos made using C# and .NET Framework.

C# Live Project: Create Custom Client Website with CRUD & Photo Storage / Retrieval Functionality
- This project is a slice of a mid-lifecycle project, which I completed during a two week sprint for Prosper IT Consulting. The client, a performing arts theater, requested no-code CRUD functionality for their website, and the ability to upload photo images to various sections of the site, which I built during the project. This was completed using ASP.NET MVC with EntityFramework, Bootstrap, and HTML/CSS. 

Car Insurance Quote Generator
- This project is an MVC app that generates sample car insurance quotes based on user-provided information. There is also an admin page that displays all generated quotes.

Twenty-One Game
- This project is a console app that showcases fundamental C# techniques to create a text-based version of the card game "Twenty-One."

Other demos showcase functions such as code-first app design with EntityFramework, text-logging, design and usage of optional parameters, lambda functions, interface polymorphism, and other common use cases for C# / .NET projects.
