# Basic C# Projects

This repository contains small projects and demos made using C# and .NET Framework.

Car Insurance
- This project is an MVC app that generates sample car insurance quotes based on user-provided information. There is also an admin page that displays all generated quotes.

Other demos showcase functions such as code-first app design with EntityFramework, text-logging, design and usage of optional parameters, lambda functions, interface polymorphism, and other common use cases for C# / .NET projects.
